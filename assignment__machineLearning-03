what kinds of objects does the YOLO sketch detect, exactly? 

Yolo's detection system looks for patterns, features and predicted movements in 
an input image and compares this to an existing database of extensive imagery. 
If the categorical image data averages out to a similar structure as the input 
image, then YOLO can output a match.

Object data is outputed as Javascript objects array items with cadigorical 
information such as: label, accuracy, position, bounding box, etc.

The sketch looks at the highest proabable match of an object in the ml5.video and 
if the predicted objects class name matches what we specify in our if statements 
we are able to have our sketch react to what YOLO sees.


Where does that list come from?

The list may come from a 'pre-trained model' library or an other image database.
It is possible for YOLO to be trained to detect new items or create new cadegories of items from an individual framework.
